During my presentation I go over matrices and how they are applied to computer science. A matrix is a set of numbers that are organized in rows and columns. There are many types of matrices that are gone into more depth in classes like Linear Algebra. We can apply many operations to these matrices such as basic addition, subtraction, and multiplication. However, when dealing with computer science, more complicated changes known as linear transformations are applied to these matrices to be able to display images on computer screens. Such transformations include rotation, scaling, translation, reflection, and shearing. Hopefully you learn some new things from this presentation.
